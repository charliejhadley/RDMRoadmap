# RDMRoadmap

This is the home of University of Oxford's Research Data Management roadmap. Designed to bring together information about projects, service improvement efforts, communication activity, and events such as taught courses.

The app is hosted as a Shiny App here: (https://martinjhnhadley.shinyapps.io/RDMRoadmap)[https://martinjhnhadley.shinyapps.io/RDMRoadmap]

Data to populate the app is provided by a number of Google Forms linked to a Google Sheet.
